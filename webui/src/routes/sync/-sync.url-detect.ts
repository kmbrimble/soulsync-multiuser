/**
 * Work out which service a pasted playlist URL belongs to.
 *
 * The page has four paste-a-URL tabs — Spotify Link, iTunes Link, Deezer Link
 * and YouTube — whose input step is identical: one field, one button. Which one
 * you must stand on is decided entirely by the string you are about to paste,
 * which is something the page can work out for itself. Making the user pick
 * first is how you get `Invalid Deezer playlist URL` from a perfectly good
 * Deezer link that happened to be pasted into the wrong tab.
 *
 * NO NEW REGEXES. Every branch delegates to the extractor that already owns
 * that service's URL shapes and is already pinned by -sync.urls.test.ts. This
 * file only decides WHICH of them applies, so detection can never disagree with
 * the parse that follows it.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing where the shapes could overlap:
 *   * the Deezer SHARE link is tested before the ordinary Deezer link, because
 *     it must produce its own actionable message rather than "not recognised";
 *   * Apple Music is tested before the generic fallbacks because its extractor
 *     accepts bare `itunes:`/`applemusic:` URI schemes that look like nothing
 *     else;
 *   * the bare-numeric case that `extractDeezerPlaylistId` accepts is
 *     deliberately NOT honoured here. A lone `12345` is not evidence of Deezer;
 *     it is evidence the user has not finished pasting.
