"""Automatic wishlist cleanup after database updates.

Runs as a background task after the library DB refresh completes — walks
every profile's wishlist, fuzzy-matches each track against the freshly
scanned library, and removes hits. Best-effort: logs and continues on
per-track failure, swallows top-level exceptions so the executor doesn't
get a propagated failure.

Lifted verbatim from web_server.py's `_automatic_wishlist_cleanup_after_db_update`.
The single global dep (`config_manager`) is passed in to keep this module
free of web_server imports.

    file lands with no record to claim it — nothing ever post-processes or
    deletes it. Streaming clients write flat into the download root, so ONLY

    quarantine and staging trees all live in subdirectories and are never
